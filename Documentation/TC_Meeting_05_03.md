## Testing
* Use Unit tests/our basic test framework as a sanity check
* Use FsCheck and the VisUAL as the 'Golden C'
* This needs to be done soon - its important to the project

## Error Messages
* Need a monad that passes through the whole project
* Likely to just be a wrapper function, around our current functionality
* On the front end, have some sort of console showing every error that is found, and the line that its on
* Monad will have a Pass and Fail type - Fail type may need a string (error message) associated with it
